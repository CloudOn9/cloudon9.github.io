#### About me:

Hello world! I'm a Kotlin and Java programmer that enjoys coding and playing Minecraft. Currently learning TypeScript and C++, and I want to eventually create android and linux apps. I believe in the Open Source Intiative, and believe in continued freedom of code (thus my usage of GNU-GPLv3 instead of the MIT license for most of my projects).
